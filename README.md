# kubernetes-hard-gcp

This is a repo in which I'll do Kubernetes the hard way tutorial 
(https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) and try to learn something about:
- Kubernetes 
- Google Cloud 
- Ansible cloud modules 

Getting Ansible running:
1. Create project `gcloud projects create --name kubernetes-hard`
1. Get credentials for google service account
1. Put google credentials json file to `secrets/service-credentials.json`
